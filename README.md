# Mark-1-Smart-Home-Lighting-System
📌 Project Description – Mark 1: Smart Home Lighting System
✅ Simulates an embedded smart lighting system using terminal commands (UART-style interface)

💡 Controls multiple virtual room lights (ON/OFF/TIMER) with real-time behavior

⏲️ Supports auto-off timers using std::chrono to simulate embedded timers

🚨 Includes an Emergency Mode to turn all lights ON

📟 Displays live status updates for each room

⚙️ Written in C++17 using OOP (classes, encapsulation, STL)

🧠 Mimics embedded system architecture — modular, efficient, event-based

🖥️ Fully functional on any PC — no hardware required

🎯 Built for learning C++, portfolio development, and Qualcomm-style embedded interviews
